# Libft  

Libft is a custom library written in C that replicates and extends functionality found in the standard C library. It includes a variety of utility functions for string manipulation, memory management, and basic data structures, serving as a foundation for future projects.  

## How It Works  
1. **Part 1: Standard Library Functions**  
   - Functions like `ft_strlen`, `ft_memcpy`, and `ft_strncmp` replicate the behavior of standard C library functions. They handle tasks like string length calculation, memory copying, and string comparison.  

2. **Part 2: Additional Utility Functions**  
   - Functions like `ft_substr` and `ft_strjoin` provide advanced string handling capabilities, while `ft_split` breaks down strings into smaller components based on delimiters.  

Each function is rigorously tested to ensure it handles edge cases, invalid inputs, and adheres to the original C standard behavior.

## What I Learned  
- The inner workings of common C library functions and their implementation.  
- Effective memory allocation and management using `malloc` and `free`.  
- Debugging techniques for handling edge cases and invalid inputs.  
- The importance of clean, reusable, and modular code in large projects.
